# Yet another BMP280.

Yet another [Bosch Sensortect BMP280 sensor](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/pressure-sensors/pressure-sensors-bmp280-1.html) library for Node.js

This library uses [i2c-bus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i2c-bus) which should provide access with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on Linux boards like the Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone or Intel Edison.

This library is heavily inspired by **Ptax**'s [BMP 280 sensor library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bmp280-sensor).
